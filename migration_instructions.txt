To update the database with the new changes, please run the following commands in the Package Manager Console:

1. Add a new migration:
   ```powershell
   Add-Migration AddPointTransactionAndUpdateCoupon
   ```

2. Update the database:
   ```powershell
   Update-Database
   ```

Note: 
- `PointTransaction` table will be created.
- `Coupons` table will be modified (Id changed to Guid). This might cause data loss if there is existing data in `Coupons` table. If you have existing data, consider a more complex migration strategy or manually handling the Id change.
- `UserCoupons` table will be updated to reference `Coupons` via Guid.
